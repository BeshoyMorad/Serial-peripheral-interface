# Serial-peripheral-interface

------------------------------------------

SPI is a synchronous, full duplex master-slave-based interface. 
Both master and slave can transmit data to each other at the same time. 
We made a 4-wire SPI that consists of 1 master and 4 slaves.


This project is made with Verilog HDL.
